This doc is inspired by the idea of [Manager README](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17001521) from hackernews. Although I am not a manager, I thought this would be a helpful manual for people to know me a bit more and make clear on what you could expect from me, especially when we work across teams.

## Who I am
- I am a Chinese guy so I prefer people to call my Chinese name Xiaomeng(晓猛). For those of you who do not know Chinese very well, the pronounciation is roughly [sh ih ow] + [m Oh ng] (or Shaw-mon roughly). Over years, I have developed a skill to know when people call my name no matter how they pronounce it. So no pressure. :)
- A bit more on myself, I came to UK in 2010 and then joined Bloomberg at 2012. I was in currency trading team for 4 years, then internally transferred to realtime data platform team. My day job is to make the data distribution system more stable so it can deliver more value to our customers.
- Apart from the day job, I am interested in all sorts of technologies that are cool and I am particularly passionate on those I can play with!

## What you can expect from me
- I work in London Hours. 9:30am to 5:30pm is my allocated time for day work and meetings, and I spend all the rest for my side projects. My lunch time is from 12:00 to 14:00. That includes a 7k run when there is no meeting scheduled at the same time.
- I read all email messages sent by human and I am aiming to respond within one working day. Use instant messenger if you need me immediately.
- I always keep my calendar up to date. If you need me for a meeting, please drop an invite at any empty slot. I acknowledge every meeting invite. I would tentatively accept it when I don't know my availability just yet.
- Generally I do not get engaged in chatroom discussion very actively. If you have important information for me, email or p2p messenger  are preferable. They just work better for me.

## What I believe in
- I firmly believe that talented people can self organize and make reasonable decisions to move things forward. I would encourage my management/peers to focus on setting the necessary context. I would do the same if I am in a position to delegate jobs to others.
- I always focus more on the future rather than the past. I would rather try and fail than not try at all. I can get very excited with new ideas. Generally I would jump into the new exciting work without making a  thorough plan upfront. Sometimes I could be quite impatient and pushy. I genuinely wish to apply better self-control, so please let me know whenever I behave not in that way.
- I am deeply motivated by my interests in technology as well as recognition from people who share similar mindset. I am generally at my best when I am doing work I believe in and feel passionate about.

## What I currently interest in
- Building a "platform"
- Machine learning tooling and deep learning
- Containers & Kubernetes
- Any technologies that may change how people live
